## 🚀 Overview

AgriBot is a four-wheel drive and four-wheel steerable robotic platform designed for precision agriculture tasks, including **targeted fertilization** and **real-time plant inspection**, specifically tailored for cabbage farming over moderately rugged terrain. The robot aims to enhance agricultural productivity and reduce labor involvement using **autonomous mobility**, **suspension system**, **image-based disease detection**, and **ROS-based control integration**.

## 🌱 Application Domain

The robot addresses key challenges in smart agriculture:

- **Precision nutrient application** to avoid overuse of fertilizers.
- **Real-time monitoring** of plant health using computer vision.
- Operation in **rugged and uneven terrains** typical to open-field farming.
- **Remote data acquisition** and daily reports for farmers.
